***Here is how the code works:***

By choosing "1", the user is able to see the text no matter if there are any changes or not, at each stage of the decryption.

The option "2" allows the user to make a change between the original character and the modified one. The original character should always be upper case, and the modified one should always be lowercase(for a better visual understanding).

The option "3" allows the user to undo the changes made to the selected modified character. For instance, if the user has changed the letter "T" to be "a", by selecting option "3" he has to input "a" in order to reverse the changes, and the text will have again the letter "T" in it.

The option "4" allows the user to check the frequency of the letter in the text, and also remind them the frequency of each letter in the english vocabulary. By selecting this option, the user is able to keep track of all the changes that were made during the start of the program.

Lastly, the option "5" exits the program, without saving any changes.
