THE TEXT:
polybius and others never said whether any of the substitutionciphers they described were
actually used, and so the first attested use ofthat genre in political affairs come from the
romans — and from the greatest roman of them all. juliuscaesar thus impressed his name
permanently into cryptology.it must be that as soon as a culture has reached a certain
level,probably measured largely by its literacy, cryptography appearsspontaneously — as its
parents, language and writing, probably also did.the multiple human needs and desires that demand
privacy among twoor more people in the midst of social life must inevitably lead tocryptology
wherever men thrive and wherever they write. culturaldiffusion seems a less likely explanation
for its occurrence in. so manyareas, many of them distant and isolated. the yezidis, an obscure
sect of about w5,000 people in, northern iraq,use a cryptic script in their holy books because
they fear persecution bytheir moslem neighbors. tibetans use a kind of cipher called "rin-
spuns"for official correspondence; it is named for its inventor rin-c'(hhen-)spuns(-pa), who
lived in the 1300s. the nsibidi secret society of nigeriakeeps its pictographic script
from europeans as much as possiblebecause it is used chiefly to express love in rather direct
imagery, andsamples appear to be at least as pornographic as they are cryptographic.the cryptography
of thailand developed under indian influence. anembryonic study of the subject even appears
in a grammatical workentitled poranavakya by hluang prasot aksaraniti (phe). one system,called
"the erring siamese," substitutes one delicate siamese letter foranother. in another
system, consonants are divided into seven groups of five letters;a letter is indicated by
writing the siamese number of its group andplacing vertical dots under it equal in number to
the letter's place in itsgroup. a system called "the hermit metamorphosing letters" writes
thetext backwards.in the europe of the latin alphabet—from which modern cryptologywould
spring—cryptography flickered weakly. with the collapse of theroman empire, europe had plunged
into the obscurity of the dark ages. literacy had all but disappeared. arts and sciences were
forgotten, andcryptography was not excepted. only during the middle ages
occasionalmanuscripts, with an infrequent signature or gloss or "deo gratias" that abored monk
put into cipher to amuse himself, fitfully illuminate thecryptologic darkness, and, like a
single candle guttering in a greatmedieval hall, their feeble flarings only emphasize the
gloom.the systems used were simple in the extreme. phrases were writtenvertically or backwards;
dots were substituted for vowels;foreign alphabets, as greek, hebrew, and armenian, were used;
eachletter of the plaintext was replaced by the one that follows it; in the mostadvanced
system, special signs substituted for letters. for almost athousand years, from before 500
to 1400, the cryptology of westerncivilization stagnated.
